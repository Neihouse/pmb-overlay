# This is a placeholder for the wireframe image file for the create overlay page.
# The file should be a PNG image showing a simple and user-friendly design for the page where users create new overlays.
# It should include elements like a text input field for the overlay description, an area for uploading a base image, customization options for the overlay (e.g., themes, color schemes), and a button or call-to-action for generating the overlay.
