# Step 1: Open a terminal or command prompt window.
# (This step is not necessary as we are already in a terminal)

# Step 2: Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
cd ~/Desktop

# Step 3: Run the command `git clone https://github.com/Neihouse/pmb-overlay-gen.git` to clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/Neihouse/pmb-overlay-gen.git

# Step 4: Wait for the cloning process to complete, which may take some time depending on the size of the repository.
# (This step is not necessary as the script will wait for the cloning process to complete before proceeding)

# Step 5: Once the cloning is complete, navigate into the cloned repository directory using `cd pmb-overlay-gen`.
cd pmb-overlay-gen

# Step 6: Verify the contents of the cloned repository by listing the files and directories using the `ls` command.
ls -l
